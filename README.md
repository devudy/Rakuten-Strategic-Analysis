Reform strategies for Rakuten to enter the UK market

Rakuten is one of the world's largest Internet service companies founded in Japan. Rakuten's business portfolio has 2 business segments,
1. Internet services: E-commerce sites, travel, books, communications, etc.
2. Financial technologies: Banking and Securities, Credit cards, Life insurance, etc.
Rakuten ruled the Japanese E-commerce market and was able to capture a lot of ground in the European and UK markets initially. They entered the European market with an excellent strategy by adding inclusivity and diversity to their management style. But when they started exploring the UK market, they faced many challenges and made many mistakes which cost them financially and market share.
In this report, we will be discussing a two-part question ie ‘What is the biggest mistake that Rakuten has made in your judgment?’ & ‘Which actions should Rakuten take to prevent those mistakes and make it more profitable?’. The objective here is to address the challenges Rakuten faced while working in the European and UK market and most importantly what major mistake Rakuten did while expanding in the UK, which made them exit the market altogether. Based on the issues they faced and the miscalculations they committed, we will analyze and devise a strategy that can be beneficial for them to re-enter and sustain in the market.
